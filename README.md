# WordsDictionary

This is the final project of the workgroup no. 5 using Xamarin.Forms and a REST API for consume it.

My workgroup choosed the WordsAPI (https://rapidapi.com/dpventures/api/wordsapi?endpoint=54b86419e4b058c0230e421c) for search definitions, synonyms and categories. The concept of our application was around a pharmacy and its products, but we did not find an API to meet our needs, so we chose to switch to an app that works as a word dictionary, and help the user with grammar topics. Our application is able to return several meanings of an entered word, as well as a synonym of it or its category.

#### EndPoints used: 
- Get Definitions
- Get Synonyms
- Get Category
- 
Note: To test replace the ApiKey to use your own WordAPI Api Key in Config.cs
